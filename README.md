The challenge here is to write code to create a table dynamically, based on the [UFO sightings data](https://github.com/BunmiOlakanmi/JavaScript_and_DOM_Manipulation/blob/main/UFO-level-1-2/static/js/data.js). To achieve this goal, a dynamic JavaScript and DOM manipulation was done to integrate JavaScript libraries to select and pull data from the JavaScript object, and the data are finally populated to a table. Users can filter the data using certain search criteria. For example, date, location in terms of city, state, and country; and shape of the UFO.

### Tools
1. JavaScript libraries:
      - D3
2. HTML
3. CSS

### Instructions
There two levels to this challenge.

#### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Level 1 involves the following basic tasks:
1.  A basic HTML page to view the table populated by the UFO sightings data, with columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape and comments.
2.  All the UFO data were appended to the table, with each new row added for each UFO sighting.
3.  A search textbox was created to search UFO data based on the date of sighting.

#### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
1. Level 2 contains all level 1 criteria with additional information. 
2. The additional task is the inclusion of multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns. This will enable users to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  - date/time
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape

### Files
1. `index.html` is the `HTML` page that renders the UFO sightings data on the web browser.
2. `UFO-level-1-2` folder contains the `static` folder which houses the `css`, `js` and `images` folders.
3. `images` folder contains some the images used in the readme file.
4. `css` folder contains the `style.css` file, which styles the `index.html` page.
5. `js` folder contains the `app.js` and `data.js` files.
6. `app.js` file contains the JavaScript code that dynamically loads and excutes user's quaery on the `index.html` page.
7. `data.js` file contains [UFO sighthings data](https://github.com/BunmiOlakanmi/JavaScript_and_DOM_Manipulation/blob/main/UFO-level-1-2/static/js/data.js)
