The challenge here is to write code to create a table dynamically, based on the [UFO sightings data](https://github.com/BunmiOlakanmi/JavaScript_and_DOM_Manipulation/blob/main/UFO-level-1-2/static/js/data.js). To achieve this goal, a dynamic JavaScript and DOM manipulation was done to integrate JavaScript libraries to select and pull data from the JavaScript object, and the data are finally populated to a table. Users can filter the data using certain search criteria. For example, date, location in terms of city, state, and country; and shape of the UFO.

### Tools
1. JavaScript libraries:
      - D3
2. HTML
3. CSS

### Instructions
There two levels to this challenge.

#### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Level 1 involves the following basic tasks:
1.  A basic HTML page to view the table populated by the UFO sightings data, with columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape and comments.
2.  All the UFO data were appended to the table, with each new row added for each UFO sighting.
3.  A search textbox was created to search UFO data based on the date of sighting.

#### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
1. Level 2 contains all level 1 criteria with additional information. 
2. The additional task is the inclusion of multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns. This will enable users to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  - date/time
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape

### Files
1. 
The UFO datasets can be found in the data.js file saved in the static/js folder route. Also, the JavaScript file to implement levels 1 and 2 is named app.js and saved in the static/js folder route, while the html file is named index.html.
